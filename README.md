# Datascience-competitions

This repo contains my code for some data science competitions:

- Female-Headed-Households-in-South-Africa:

The objective of this challenge is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the % of households per ward that are female-headed and living below a particular income threshold by using data points that can be collected through other means without an intensive household survey like the census.

- Financial-Inclusion-in-Africa:

The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. 

- Heart-Disease:

The goal of this project is to predict the binary class heart_disease_present, which represents whether or not a patient has heart disease
