# Financial-Inclusion-in-Africa

The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. The models and solutions developed can provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ financial outcomes.

The evaluation metric will be the percentage of survey respondents for whom you predict the binary 'bank account' classification incorrectly.

The main dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 33,610 individuals across East Africa. This data was extracted from various Finscope surveys ranging from 2016 to 2018.

The project was introduced by Zindi, the first data science competition platform in Africa, and was part of the qualification process to attend AI Hack Tunisia 2019.
