# Heart-Disease

Heart disease is the number one cause of death worldwide, so if you're looking to use data science for good you've come to the right place. To learn how to prevent heart disease we must first learn to reliably detect it.

The goal of this project is to predict the binary class heart_disease_present, which represents whether or not a patient has heart disease:

- 0 represents no heart disease present
- 1 represents heart disease present

The dataset is is one of the smallest datasets on DrivenData.org .. It contains 14 columns, the first one -patient_id- is a unique and random identifier.

This project is part of the heart disease competition in DrivenData, for more information please visit this link https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/54/machine-learning-with-a-heart/
