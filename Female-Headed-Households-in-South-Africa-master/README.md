# Female-Headed-Households-in-South-Africa

Compared to male-headed households, female-headed households tend to face greater social and economic challenges. Female-headed households, in general, are more vulnerable to lower household incomes and higher rates of poverty.

The objective of this challenge is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the % of households per ward that are female-headed and living below a particular income threshold by using data points that can be collected through other means without an intensive household survey like the census.

This solution can potentially reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of monitoring key population indicators such as female household headship and income level in between census years. The winning solutions will be made publicly available at the end of the competition.

This competition is sponsored by Women in Big Data South Africa and Microsoft, in collaboration with HERE Technologies; and was hosted as a competition in [Zindi](https://zindi.africa) Platform
